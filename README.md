## Project Name
  Bubba - An AI-Augmented Reality Companion
  
## Tagline
  Our app prioritizes the use of AI and AR technology to provide personalized, engaging, and lifelike support for individuals struggling with depression and other mental health issues. 
  
## The problem it solves

### Problem
    Millions of people around the world suffer from depression, a major mental illness. 
    Many adverse effects can occur, including reduced quality of life, social isolation, and even suicide.
    Despite the fact that there are many different treatment options, many people who suffer from depression 
    choose not to seek professional help or benefit from conventional treatments. 
    Also, not everyone will always have access to or be able to afford in-person therapy.
### Solution
  Our solution aims in developing an AI-augmented reality companion, offering a creative approach to the depression issue. The virtual companion can make use of cutting-edge innovations like AI and AR to offer emotional support and individualised suggestions for coping mechanisms. In order to encourage the user to explore their thoughts and feelings in a secure and non-judgmental setting, it can also offer a listening ear and a supportive presence. <br>
  The virtual companion can comprehend the user's emotional state and offer tailored recommendations for coping mechanisms by integrating AI functions. It can provide a variety of functions, such as guided meditations, mood monitoring, and exercises that encourage optimistic thinking.Also, the virtual companion can offer a secure and encouraging environment for users to share their feelings, which is particularly helpful for people who might not have access to in-person treatment. <br>
  Users can engage with the virtual companion and access its functions easily, as it is designing with an intuitive user interface. The usage of AR technology can give the user a distinctive and immersive experience, enhancing the interaction and engagement of the virtual companion. It may enhance people's general mental health and well-being by making them feel supported and understood.
